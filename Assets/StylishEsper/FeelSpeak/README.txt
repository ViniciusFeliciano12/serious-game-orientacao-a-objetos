Demo Setup Steps
----------------
1. Go into the 'Examples' folder and import the 'DemoAssets.unitpackage.'

2. From the same folder, import the 'DemoScenes.unitypackage.' 

3. Navigate to Window > Feel Speak > Settings and click the 'Validate' button.

4. From the 'Examples' folder pick either the 2D or 3D demo to try out.

You may notice some errors after import. Usually they are nothing to worry about.

NOTE: The 3D demo may not work in HDRP.
